# DEVTOWN-TAILWINDCSS-PROJECT
Personal Portfolio using Tailwind CSS

Creating this portfolio was a great learning experience in combining design and functionality. Using Tailwind CSS, I built a responsive, visually appealing site to showcase Divya Jain's data analysis skills. The animated gradient, interactive elements, and project cards highlight her expertise while ensuring a smooth user experience. Balancing aesthetics with performance was key, and I enjoyed implementing subtle animations and clean layouts. This project strengthened my front-end development skills and understanding of modern web design principles.
